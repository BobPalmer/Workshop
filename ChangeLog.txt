	Added settings options to control whether KAC alarms are set
	Implemented changes in part functionality when being used standalone:
		Regarding the stand-alone tech:

			* 3D Printing Lab, Advanced Exploration.  Can print parts
			* Recycling, Field Science (using the AICore part), Can recycle parts into what they were made from.  45% recovery
			* Ore Processing﻿, Advanced Science Tech, can process ore into MaterialKits
			* Material Extractor, Advanced Science Tech, can process ore into MaterialKits, Dirt into ExoticMinerals and RareMetals

		Stock scanners and drills, Adding Dirt,ExoticMinerals and RareMetals to stock scanners and drills
		if EL, MKS  is installed:

			* 3D Printing Lab, Advanced Exploration, can print parts, can recycle parts
			* Workshop AI Core, Field Science, can print parts, can recycle parts, automated
			* Workshop Chemical, Advanced Science Tech, can print parts, can recycle parts, can convert ore to MaterialKits
			* Material Extractor, Advanced Science Tech, can process ore into MaterialKits, Dirt into ExoticMinerals and RareMetals
